	<h2>Growth</h2>
	<p>In life, growth is just one of those things that's ultimately inevitable. It's somethng you can't evade whether you run for your life and seek asylum in Mexico or you go to the East in search of a life of Budhism. Wherever it is you end up, people will expect you to grow. You''l be in an office and people will expect you to move from one position to another. You'll be in a classroom and people will expect you to move from one class to another. You'll be in a relationship and people ill expect you to move from one stage to another. In short, all am saying is that growth is inevitable. So if you've been trying to evade it, it's about time you realised that you can run but you can't hide.</p>
